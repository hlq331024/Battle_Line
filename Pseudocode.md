### *#1 Battleline Rules*

+ 60 troop cards, in 6 colors, each from 1 to 10
+ 10 tactics cards
+ 9 flags

Start from 7 troop cards for each player

+ win 3 **adjacent** flags or **any** 5 flags to achieve victory

If the player is unable to play any troop card, he may pass of play a tactics card. This may happen when

+ the player has filled all his available "slots" on his side if the battleline
+ the player has only tactics cards in his hand

The four different "formations" from highest to lowest are

+ 同花顺. Wedge.
+ 炸弹. Phalanx.
+ 同花. Battalion order.
+ 顺子. Skirmish line.
+ 其他. Host.

On his turn, and before finally drawing his card from the deck, a player may claim one or more flags. In order to do so, he must

+ have a completed "formation" of 3 cards
+ be able to prove that troop cards on the opponent's side cannot beat this "formation"

**The following** is new to me, please check it out

> If the "formations" on either side of a flag are tied or at best could be tied, then the player who played (or would play) the last card into the "formations" loses the flag. His opponent may claim it on his **next turn**.

So, **this** turn or **next** turn?

There are 10 tatics cards

+ Alexander.

+ Darius.

+ Companion cavalry. 战术 8.

+ Shield bearers. 战术 123.

+ Fog. 比大小.

+ Mud. 四张牌.

+ Scout. 观星.

  **The following** is new to me, please check it out

  > The player draws a total of 3 cards from one or both decks. Then he chooses **any two** cards from his hand and places them face down on top of their respective deck or decks.
  
  So, **any two** cards or **two from the 3** cards he drew in this round?

+ Redeploy. 重新部署.

+ Deserter. 过河拆桥. The player may choose to discard any one troop or tatics card from his opponent's side.

+ Traitor. 顺手牵羊. The player may take only one troop card from his opponent's side.

If several games are played, the winner always scores 5 points, and the loser scores as many points as flags he has claimed.

One may also try the "advanced" rule: a player may only claim flags at the beginning of his turn.
